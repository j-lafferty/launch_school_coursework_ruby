# Write a method that takes a positive integer, n, as an argument, and displays a right triangle whose sides each have n stars. The hypotenuse of the triangle (the diagonal side in the images below) should have one end at the lower-left of the triangle, and the other end at the upper-right.

def triangle(num)
  1.upto(num) { |i| puts ('*' * i).rjust(num) }
end

# Examples:

triangle(5)
